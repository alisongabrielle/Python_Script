# Python_Script

This whole repo is for my python scripts that saved my laziness :D
If you're here to use them, I recommend doing the following:
  - Most scripts only applies to using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets ( I know -Google Sheets imagine-)
  - I'm not fluent in Python so credits to the people that helped me wrote all scripts
  - I found this in open source (aka Google lol) and modified the following for the purpose I've always written
  - If you're here from a class, well hello because I'm writing this currently as an undergraduate. (Lowkey wanna know my future reaction reading the README)
